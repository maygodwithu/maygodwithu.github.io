Dear, Professor Yoon.

I’m Jack Choi from NAVER SEARCH CIC.

( my page :  https://maygodwithu.github.io/ )

About 5 years ago, you were a PhD student at Harvard and visited NAVER to talk.

I'm glad to hear that you are a MIT professor.


I started my PhD course at a late age, I am due to receive my PhD (IR and NLP area) in August of this year.

After completing the PhD course, I’m planning to get a ‘visiting scholar’ and research in the United States for about an year.


I’m contacting you about ‘visiting scalar’.

I would like to ask if I can get a 'visiting scholar' from you.


I am in charge of one industry-academic research project between Seoul National University and NAVER,

which is to improve the BERT-based Neural Ranking Model.

I will continue this research during my visit to the United States, and write a paper using the result of the study.


I read 'Emergence of Separable Manifolds in Deep Language Representations' with interest.

I think the deep understanding of BERT’s representation is needed to improve BERT based models.


I am attaching my CV and the research plan to conduct over the year.

This is a long email, but thank you for taking the time to read it.

I look forward to hear from you.


Thank you.

Best regards.
